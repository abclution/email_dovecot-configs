# If nothing happens for this long while client is IDLEing, move the connection
# to imap-hibernate process and close the old imap process. This saves memory,
# because connections use very little memory in imap-hibernate process. The
# downside is that recreating the imap process back uses some resources.

# Maximum IMAP command line length. Some clients generate very long command
# lines with huge mailboxes, so you may need to raise this if you get
# "Too long argument" or "IMAP command line too large" errors often.

#  %{fetch_body_count} - Number of mails with mail body data sent to client
#  %{fetch_body_bytes} - Number of bytes with mail body data sent to client
#  %{deleted} - Number of mails where client added \Deleted flag
#  %{expunged} - Number of mails that client expunged, which does not
#                include automatically expunged mails
#  %{autoexpunged} - Number of mails that were automatically expunged after
#                    client disconnected

# Workarounds for various client bugs:
#   delay-newmail:
#     Send EXISTS/RECENT new mail notifications only when replying to NOOP
#     and CHECK commands. Some clients ignore them otherwise, for example OSX
#     Mail (<v2.1). Outlook Express breaks more badly though, without this it
#     may show user "Message no longer in server" errors. Note that OE6 still
#     breaks even with this workaround if synchronization is set to
#     "Headers Only".
#   tb-extra-mailbox-sep:
#     Thunderbird gets somehow confused with LAYOUT=fs (mbox and dbox) and
#     adds extra '/' suffixes to mailbox names. This option causes Dovecot to
#     ignore the extra '/' instead of treating it as invalid mailbox name.
#   tb-lsub-flags:
#     Show \Noselect flags for LSUB replies with LAYOUT=fs (e.g. mbox).
#     This makes Thunderbird realize they aren't selectable and show them
#     greyed out, instead of only later giving "not selectable" popup error.

# What happens when FETCH fails due to some internal error:
#   disconnect-immediately:
#     The FETCH is aborted immediately and the IMAP client is disconnected.
#   disconnect-after:
#     The FETCH runs for all the requested mails returning as much data as
#     possible. The client is finally disconnected without a tagged reply.
#   no-after:
#     Same as disconnect-after, but tagged NO reply is sent instead of
#     disconnecting the client. If the client attempts to FETCH the same failed
#     mail more than once, the client is disconnected. This is to avoid clients
#     from going into infinite loops trying to FETCH a broken mail.

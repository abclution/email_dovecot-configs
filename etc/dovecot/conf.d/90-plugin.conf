# ACL plugin. vfile backend reads ACLs from "dovecot-acl" file from maildir
# directory. You can also optionally give a global ACL directory path where
# ACLs are applied to all users' mailboxes. The global ACL directory contains
# one file for each mailbox, eg. INBOX or sub.mailbox. cache_secs parameter
# specifies how many seconds to wait between stat()ing dovecot-acl file
# to see if it changed.

  # The default escape character is '\', but you can change it.
  # Note that even here the expansion of % takes place, thus you need to
  # use "%%" if you want to have the % sign as the escape character.
